---------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Configure Applications and Topology
---------------------------------------------------------------



### 4.1 Create Kubernetes Observer for the Demo Applications

Do this for your applications (RobotShop by default)

* In CP4WAIOPS go into `Define` / `Data and tool integrations` / `Advanced` / `Manage ObserverJobs` / `Add a new Job`
* Select `Kubernetes` / `Configure`
* Choose “local”
* Set Unique ID to `<app-namespace>` (robot-shop,...)
* Set Datacenter (I use "demo")
* Set `Correlate` to `true`
* Set Namespace to `<app-namespace>` (robot-shop, ...)
* Set Provider to whatever you like (usually I set it to “listenJob” as well)
* `Save`


### 4.2 Create REST Observer to Load Topologies

* In CP4WAIOPS go into `Define` / `Data and tool integrations` / `Advanced` / `Manage ObserverJobs` / `Add a new Job`
* Select `REST`/ `Configure`
* Choose “bulk_replace”
* Set Unique ID to “listenJob” (important!)
* Set Provider to whatever you like (usually I set it to “listenJob” as well)
* `Save`



### 4.3 Create Merge Rules for Kubernetes Observer

Launch the following:

```bash
./tools/5_topology/create-merge-rules.sh
```


### 4.4 Load Merge Topologies

This will load the overlay topology for RobotShop:

```bash
./tools/5_topology/create-merge-topology-robotshop.sh

```

This will create Merge Topologies for RobotShop.

❗ Please manually re-run the Kubernetes Observer to make sure that the merge has been done.


### 4.5 Create AIOps Application

#### Robotshop

* In CP4WAIOPS go into `Operate` / `Application Management` 
* Click `Create Application`
* Select `robot-shop` namespace
* Click `Add to Application`
* Name your Application (RobotShop)
* If you like check `Mark as favorite`
* Click `Save`







---------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Training
---------------------------------------------------------------
### 6.1 Train Log Anomaly - RobotShop


#### 6.1.1 Create Kafka Training Integration

* In the CP4WAIOPS "Hamburger" Menu select `Operate`/`Data and tool integrations`
* Under `Kafka`, click on `Add Integration`
* Name it `HumioInject`
* Select `Data Source` / `Logs`
* Select `Mapping Type` / `Humio`
* Paste the following in `Mapping` (the default is **incorrect**!:

	```json
	{
	"codec": "humio",
	"message_field": "@rawstring",
	"log_entity_types": "kubernetes.namespace_name,kubernetes.container_hash,kubernetes.host,kubernetes.container_name,kubernetes.pod_name",
	"instance_id_field": "kubernetes.container_name",
	"rolling_time": 10,
	"timestamp_field": "@timestamp"
	}
	```
	
* Toggle `Data Flow` to the `ON` position
* Select `Data feed for initial AI Training`
* Click `Save`

#### 6.1.2 Load Training Data into Kafka (Option 1: faster)

1. First unzip the file robotshop-12h.zip
	
	```bash
	cd ./training/TRAINING_FILES/KAFKA/robot-shop/logs
	unzip robotshop-12h.zip
	cd -
	```


1. Run the script to inject training data:
	
	```bash
	./training/robotshop-train-logs.sh
	```
	This takes some time (20-60 minutes depending on your Internet speed).




#### 6.1.2.1 Load Training Data directly into ElasticSearch (Option 2: Slower)

1. First unzip the file robotshop-logtrain.zip
	
	```bash
	cd ./training/TRAINING_FILES/ELASTIC/robot-shop/logs/
	unzip robotshop-logtrain.zip
	cd -
	```

1. Run this command in a separate terminal window to gain access to the Elasticsearch cluster:

	```bash
	while true; do oc port-forward statefulset/$(oc get statefulset | grep iaf-system-elasticsearch-es-aiops | awk '{print $1}') 9200; done
	```


1. Run the script to inject training data:
	
	```bash
	./training/robotshop-train-logs-es.sh
	```
	This takes some time (40-90 minutes depending on your Internet speed).


If you want to check if the training data has been loaded you can execute (make sure you're on your aiops project/namespace):

```bash
oc exec -it $(oc get po |grep aimanager-aio-ai-platform-api-server|awk '{print$1}') -- bash


bash-4.4$ curl -u elastic:$ES_PASSWORD -XGET https://elasticsearch-ibm-elasticsearch-ibm-elasticsearch-srv.<YOUR WAIOPS NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local:443/_cat/indices  --insecure | grep logtrain | sort
```

You should get something like this (for 20210505 and 20210506):

```bash
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  2716  100  2716    0     0   9769      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  9769
yellow open 1000-1000-20210505-logtrain      06XVqpPTTlCPYlIfZqr-bA 1 1 315652 0  94.2mb  94.2mb
yellow open 1000-1000-20210506-logtrain      slP32RncT-eCEPiUPWrDDg 1 1 385026 0 114.4mb 114.4mb
```


#### 6.1.3 Create Training Definition

* Select `Add Data`
* Select `05/05/21` (May 5th 2021 - dd/mm/yy) to `07/05/21` (May 7th 2021) as date range (this is when the logs we're going to inject have been created)
* Click `Next`
* Name it "LogAnomaly"
* Click `Next`
* Click `Create`


#### 6.1.4 Train the model

* In the training definition click on `Actions` / `Start Training`
* This will start a precheck that should tell you after a while that you are ready for training

---------------------------------------------------------------
## 10. Some Polishing
---------------------------------------------------------------

### 10.1 Add LDAP Logins to CP4WAIOPS


* Go to CP4AIOps Dashboard
* Click on the top left "Hamburger" menu
* Select `User Management`
* Select `User Groups` Tab
* Click `New User Group`
* Enter demo (or whatever you like)
* Click Next
* Select `LDAP Groups`
* Search for `demo`
* Select `cn=demo,ou=Groups,dc=ibm,dc=com`
* Click Next
* Select Roles (I use Administrator for the demo environment)

### 10.2 Get Passwords and Credentials

At any moment you can run `./82_monitor_kafka.sh` this allows you to:

* List all Kafka Topics
* Monitor Derived Stories
* Monitor any specific Topic

You can monitor:

* **derived-stories**: Here you see the stories that get created and pushed to Slack/Teams
* **alerts-noi-1000-1000**: Check if Events from Event Manager are coming in and the Gateway is working as expected (only INSERTS are appearing here, so you might have to delete the Events in Event Manager first in order to recreate them)
* **windowed-logs-1000-1000**: Check log data flowing for log anomaly detection (NOT training)
